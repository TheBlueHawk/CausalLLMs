Step 1) Extract the causal graph: The causal graph expressed in the context is: "{graph}".

Step 2) Identify the query type: The query type of the above question is "{query_type}".

Step 3) Translate the query to an estimand: Based on the type of the causal query, the question can be translated to a formal estimand as: "{step1}".

Step 4) Collect all the available data: The available data are: "{given_info_formal}".

Step 5) Solve for the estimand: To solve for the estimand, we need to compute {step1_format}.

Using the causal graph, we can simplify the estimand to
{step1}
= {step2}

Using the available data, we can calculate:
{step2}
= {step3}
â‰ˆ {step4}

Since the estimate for the estimand is {step4}, the overall answer to the question is "{answer}".
