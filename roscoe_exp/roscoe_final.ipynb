      "Step 1) Extract the causal graph: What is the causal graph expressed in the context? Use \"X\" to denote \"gender\". Use \"V2\" to denote \"department applying to\". Use \"V3\" to denote \"residency status\". Use \"Y\" to denote \"admission status\". Answer nothing else but each edge one by one, in the format of \"var1 -> var2\", and use \",\" to separate the edges.\n",

Choose one from \"marginal probability\", \"conditional probability\", \"explaining away effect\", \"backdoor adjustment set\", \"average treatment effect\", \"collider bias\", \"normal counterfactual question\", \"average treatment effect on treated\", \"natural direct effect\", or \"natural indirect effect\". Answer nothing else but a quoted choice from above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3) Translate the query to an estimand: Based on the type of the causal query, translate the question to a formal estimand. Use the \"do(·)\" notation or counterfactual notations whenever necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4) Collect all the available data: Extract all available data. Answer nothing else but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities, in the form of \"P(...)=...\" or \"P(...|...)=...\", and use \";\" to separate each of them. Use \"X\" to denote \"gender\". Use \"V2\" to denote \"department applying to\". Use \"V3\" to denote \"residency status\". Use \"Y\" to denote \"admission status\".\n",

Since we want to understand how the gene affects lung cancer, we need to consider the effect of the gene on smoking status and the effect of smoking status on lung cancer. Therefore, we should look at the correlation case by case according to gene, smoking status, and lung cancer. So, the answer is \"No\".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2\n",

       "Step 1) Extract the causal graph: The causal graph expressed in the context is \"V1 -> X, V3 -> Y, X -> Y\".\\n\\nStep 2) Identify the query type: The query type of the above question is \"average treatment effect\".\\n\\nStep 3) Translate the query to an estimand: Based on the type of the causal query, the question can be translated to a formal estimand as E[Y|do(X=1)] - E[Y|do(X=0)].\\n\\nStep 4) Collect all the available data: The available data are P(Y=1|V1=0, X=0)=0.3195; P(Y=1|V1=0, X=1)=0.3141; P(Y=1|V1=1, X=0)=0.3525; P(Y=1|V1=1, X=1)=0.2559; P(V1=1)=0.2.\\n\\nStep 5) Solve for the estimand: \\n\\nFirst, we need to find the probabilities of X=0 and X=1. We know that P(V1=1)=0.2, so P(V1=0)=0.8. Since V1 directly affects X, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:\\n\\nP(X=0|V1=0) = P(Y=1|V1=0, X=0) / (P(Y=1|V1=0, X=0) + P(Y=1|V1=0, X=1)) = 0.3195 / (0.3195 + 0.3141) ≈ 0.504\\nP(X=1|V1=0) = 1 - P(X=0|V1=0) ≈ 0.496\\n\\nP(X=0|V1=1) = P(Y=1|V1=1, X=0) / (P(Y=1|V1=1, X=0) + P(Y=1|V1=1, X=1)) = 0.3525 / (0.3525 + 0.2559) ≈ 0.579\\nP(X=1|V1=1) = 1 - P(X=0|V1=1) ≈ 0.421\\n\\nNow, we can find the marginal probabilities of X=0 and X=1:\\n\\nP(X=0) = P(X=0|V1=0) * P(V1=0) + P(X=0|V1=1) * P(V1=1) ≈ 0.504 * 0.8 + 0.579 * 0.2 ≈ 0.517\\nP(X=1) = 1 - P(X=0) ≈ 0.483\\n\\nNext, we can find the probabilities of Y=1 given X=0 and X=1:\\n\\nP(Y=1|X=0) = P(Y=1|V1=0, X=0) * P(V1=0|X=0) + P(Y=1|V1=1, X=0) * P(V1=1|X=0)\\nP(Y=1|X=1) = P(Y=1|V1=0, X=1) * P(V1=0|X=1) + P(Y=1|V1=1, X=1) * P(V1=1|X=1)\\n\\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we can find P(V1=0|X=0), P(V1=1|X=0), P(V1=0|X=1), and P(V1=1|X=1):\\n\\nP(V1=0|X=0) = P(X=0|V1=0) * P(V1=0) / P(X=0) ≈ 0.504 * 0.8 / 0.517 ≈ 0.780\\nP(V1=1|X=0) = 1 - P(V1=0|X=0) ≈ 0.220\\n\\nP(V1=0|X=1) = P(X=1|V1=0) * P(V1=0) / P(X=1) ≈ 0.496 * 0.8 / 0.483 ≈ 0.820\\nP(V1=1|X=1) = 1 - P(V1=0|X=1) ≈ 0.180\\n\\nNow, we can calculate P(Y=1|X=0) and P(Y=1|X=1):\\n\\nP(Y=1|X=0) ≈ 0.3195 * 0.780 + 0.3525 *    1\n",

       "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Severe vaccination reaction has a direct effect on the habit of using chopsticks instead of forks and smallpox survival. Absence of smallpox has a direct effect on the habit of using chopsticks instead of forks. The habit of using chopsticks instead of forks has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Vaccination reaction is unobserved. For individuals with smallpox, the probability of smallpox survival is 60.72%. For individuals without smallpox, the probability of smallpox survival is 74.46%. For individuals with smallpox, the probability of the habit of using chopsticks instead of forks is 40.00%. For individuals without smallpox, the probability of the habit of using chopsticks instead of forks is 84.00%. If we disregard the mediation effect through smallpox condtion, would the habit of using chopsticks instead of forks still positively affect smallpox survival?\\n\\nHint: You can answer the question by following the subquestions below:\\n\\nStep 1) Extract the causal graph: What is the causal graph expressed in the context? Use \"V2\" to denote \"smallpox condtion\". Use \"V1\" to denote \"vaccination reaction\". Use \"X\" to denote \"the habit of using chopsticks instead of forks\". Use \"Y\" to denote \"a person\". Answer nothing else but each edge one by one, in the format of \"var1 -> var2\", and use \",\" to separate the edges.\\n\\nStep 2) Identify the query type: What is the query type of the above question? Choose one from \"marginal probability\", \"conditional probability\", \"explaining away effect\", \"backdoor adjustment set\", \"average treatment effect\", \"collider bias\", \"normal counterfactual question\", \"average treatment effect on treated\", \"natural direct effect\", or \"natural indirect effect\". Answer nothing else but a quoted choice from above.\\n\\nStep 3) Translate the query to an estimand: Based on the type of the causal query, translate the question to a formal estimand. Use the \"do(·)\" notation or counterfactual notations whenever necessary.\\n\\nStep 4) Collect all the available data: Extract all available data. Answer nothing else but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities, in the form of \"P(...)=...\" or \"P(...|...)=...\", and use \";\" to separate each of them. Use \"V2\" to denote \"smallpox condtion\". Use \"V1\" to denote \"vaccination reaction\". Use \"X\" to denote \"the habit of using chopsticks instead of forks\". Use \"Y\" to denote \"a person\".\\n\\nStep 5) Solve for the estimand: Given all the information above, solve for the estimand mentioned before using causal inference skills such as do-calculus, counterfactual prediction, and the basics of probabilities.
