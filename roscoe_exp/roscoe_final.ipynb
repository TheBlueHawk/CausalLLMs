Use \"V3\" to denote \"residency status\". Use \"Y\" to denote \"admission status\". Answer nothing else but each edge one by one, in the format of \"var1 -> var2\", and use \",\" to separate the edges.\n",

Choose one from \"marginal probability\", \"conditional probability\", \"explaining away effect\", \"backdoor adjustment set\", \"average treatment effect\", \"collider bias\", \"normal counterfactual question\", \"average treatment effect on treated\", \"natural direct effect\", or \"natural indirect effect\". Answer nothing else but a quoted choice from above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3) Translate the query to an estimand: Based on the type of the causal query, translate the question to a formal estimand. Use the \"do(·)\" notation or counterfactual notations whenever necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4) Collect all the available data: Extract all available data. Answer nothing else but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities, in the form of \"P(...)=...\" or \"P(...|...)=...\", and use \";\" to separate each of them. Use \"X\" to denote \"gender\". Use \"V2\" to denote \"department applying to\". Use \"V3\" to denote \"residency status\". Use \"Y\" to denote \"admission status\".\n",

We know that P(Y=1|X=1) = 0.7082, which is the probability of thick lips when supply is increased.

Choose one from \"marginal probability\", \"conditional probability\", \"explaining away effect\", \"backdoor adjustment set\", \"average treatment effect\", \"collider bias\", \"normal counterfactual question\", \"average treatment effect on treated\", \"natural direct effect\", or \"natural indirect effect\". Answer nothing else but a quoted choice from above.\\n\\nStep 3) Translate the query to an estimand: Based on the type of the causal query, translate the question to a formal estimand. Use the \"do(·)\" notation or counterfactual notations whenever necessary.\\n\\nStep 4) Collect all the available data: Extract all available data. Answer nothing else but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities, in the form of \"P(...)=...\" or \"P(...|...)=...\", and use \";\" to separate each of them.

Vaccination has a direct effect on smallpox survival. Severe vaccination reaction has a direct effect on smallpox survival. For individuals with smallpox and unvaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 67.33%. For individuals with smallpox and vaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 44.94%. For individuals without smallpox and unvaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 69.00%. For individuals without smallpox and vaccinated individuals, the probability of smallpox survival is 36.52%. The overall probability of absence of smallpox is 30.00%. If we disregard the mediation effect through smallpox condtion, would vaccination still positively affect smallpox survival?\\n\\nHint: You can answer the question by following the subquestions below:\\n\\nStep 1) Extract the causal graph: What is the causal graph expressed in the context? Use \"V1\" to denote \"smallpox condtion\". Use \"V3\" to denote \"vaccination reaction\". Use \"X\" to denote \"vaccination status\". Use \"Y\" to denote \"a person\". Answer nothing else but each edge one by one, in the format of \"var1 -> var2\", and use \",\" to separate the edges.\\n\\nStep 2) Identify the query type: What is the query type of the above question? Choose one from \"marginal probability\", \"conditional probability\", \"explaining away effect\", \"backdoor adjustment set\", \"average treatment effect\", \"collider bias\", \"normal counterfactual question\", \"average treatment effect on treated\", \"natural direct effect\", or \"natural indirect effect\". Answer nothing else but a quoted choice from above.\\n\\nStep 3) Translate the query to an estimand: Based on the type of the causal query, translate the question to a formal estimand. Use the \"do(·)\" notation or counterfactual notations whenever necessary.\\n\\nStep 4) Collect all the available data: Extract all available data. Answer nothing else but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities, in the form of \"P(...)=...\" or \"P(...|...)=...\", and use \";\" to separate each of them. Use \"V1\" to denote \"smallpox condtion\". Use \"V3\" to denote \"vaccination reaction\". Use \"X\" to denote \"vaccination status\". Use \"Y\" to denote \"a person\".\\n\\nStep 5) Solve for the estimand: Given all the information above, solve for the estimand mentioned before using causal inference skills such as do-calculus, counterfactual prediction, and the basics of probabilities. Answer step by step.    1\n",
